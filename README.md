# Knights Path

This repo contains my solution to the knights path problem.

This algorithm uses a breadth-first search approach to find the shortest path. I could not get a depth first approach to work as I cannot find a heuristic that allows me to eliminate any branches of the tree.

Also due to the bishop I was not able to find an O(1) solution that is possible when their is no bishop and the minimum number of moves to complete any given vector can be worked out with a formula.

Please let me know if this solution can be improved at all.
